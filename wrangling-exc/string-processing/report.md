Introduction
------------

This is a report on deaths from 2015 until May 31, 2018 obtained from the pdf titled RD-Mortality-Report\_2015-18-180531.pdf from the dslabs library. This is loosely based on the exercises from [the string processing chapter of Rafael A. Irizarry's Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html)

Deaths by date
--------------

We note the seasonality with a peak around the new year by generating a smoothed plot of deaths by date:
